# Rusty Hogs
Rusty Hog is a secret scanner built in Rust for performance, and based on TruffleHog which is written
in Python. Rusty Hog provides the following binaries:

* Ankamali Hog: Scans for secrets in a Google doc.
* Berkshire Hog: Scans for secrets in an S3 bucket.
* Choctaw Hog: Scans for secrets in a Git repository.
* Duroc Hog: Scans for secrets in a directory, file, and archive.
* Gottingen Hog: Scans for secrets in a JIRA issue.

# Usage

This project provides a set of scanners that use regular expressions to try and detect the presence of sensitive
information, such as API keys, passwords, and personal information. It includes a set of regular expressions by
default, but also accepts a JSON object containing your custom regular expressions.

## How to install
Download and unzip the [latest ZIP](https://github.com/newrelic/rusty-hog/releases/)
on the releases tab. Then, run each binary with `-h` to see the usage.

```shell script
wget https://github.com/newrelic/rusty-hog/releases/download/v1.0.5/rustyhogs-musl_darwin_1.0.5.zip
unzip rustyhogs-musl_darwin_1.0.5.zip
darwin_releases/choctaw_hog -h
```

## How to build
- Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) installed and on your path.
- Clone this repo, and then run `cargo build --release`. The binaries are located in `target/release`.
- To build and view HTML documents, run ```cargo doc --no-deps --open```.
- To run unit tests, run ```cargo test```.
- To cross-compile Berkshire Hog for the AWS Lambda environment, first install
[cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross). Then run the following commands and upload berkshire_lambda.zip to
your AWS Lambda dashboard:
```shell script
cross build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/berkshire_hog bootstrap
zip -j berkshire_lambda.zip bootstrap
```

## How to build on Windows
You will need to compile static OpenSSL binaries and tell Rust/Cargo where to find them:
```
mkdir \Tools
cd \Tools
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows-static

$env:OPENSSL_DIR = 'C:\Tools\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows-static'
$env:OPENSSL_STATIC = 'Yes'
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENSSL_DIR', $env:OPENSSL_DIR, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENSSL_STATIC', $env:OPENSSL_STATIC, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```
You can now follow the main build instructions listed above.

## Berkshire Hog (S3 Scanner - Lambda) usage
Berkshire Hog is currently designed to be used as a Lambda function. This is the basic data flow:
<pre>
    ┌───────────┐              ┌───────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
    │ S3 bucket │ ┌────────┐   │       │     │ Berkshire Hog  │     │ S3 bucket  │
    │  (input) ─┼─┤S3 event├──▶│  SQS  │────▶│    (Lambda)    │────▶│  (output)  │
    │           │ └────────┘   │       │     │                │     │            │
    └───────────┘              └───────┘     └────────────────┘     └────────────┘
</pre>

In order to run Berkshire Hog this way, set up the following:
1) Configure the input bucket to send an "event" to SQS for each PUSH/PUT event.
2) Set up the SQS topic to accept events from S3, including IAM permissions.
3) Run Berkshire Hog with IAM access to SQS and S3.

## What does the name mean?
TruffleHog is considered the de facto standard / original secret scanner. I have been
building a suite of secret scanning tools for various platforms based on TruffleHog
and needed a naming scheme, so I started at the top of Wikipedia's
[list of pig breeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pig_breeds).
Thus each tool name is a breed of pig starting at "A" and working up.
